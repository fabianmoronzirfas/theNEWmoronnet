<h2>interpretation</h2><h3>how do people react on noise?</h3>
Different people react in diffrent ways.
On construction sounds or children or traffic.
How can the perception of noise be messured?
Is there a value that oscillates between anoying and nice?
And there were more questions.
<h3>How could this be meassured?</h3>
With <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewanalytics?formkey=dDUyOHdrQl9LZVRVQ05Na2FhWm9MSFE6MQ" target="blanc">survey</a> (only in german) we tried to get our hands on some data. At this moment it's the perception of 39 people. But there is no live-stream.
<h3>How to visualise that in multitouch?</h3>
Based on the data we got from the survey we build some graphs and tried to understand. Of course are some things obvious. Like the perception of traffic in general. But some smaller differences are interesting.
people like children a bit more than dogs. But only at daytime.
And everybody loves lightning and thunder at night.
Finaly ( and because we were eager to make something beautiful ) we choose a metaphor to explain the data.
The always flowing circle as an image for the never stopping life in the city.
The particle, as the person wo reacts on sound, has to make his way throug space. the typo obstacles are noises that interfear with the mood of the masses.
We splitted this in three different spaces.
Public space ( the inner ring) , private space ( in the middle ) and workspace ( the outter ring ) . We also made a difference between the perception on day and night.

See the showreel / documentation video <a href="http://www.the-moron.net/project/UELaerm/UELaermVideo.html" target="blanc">here.</a>
See and download the project presentation as .pdf <a href="http://project.the-moron.net/UELaerm/TMNUElaerm.pdf"target ="blanc">here.</a>

<h3>What is the next step?</h3>
The next step would be implementing sound. There are some ideas around like making a sound layover controlled by the active objects there size and there position. But nothing really final.
