title: Connected Nodes
---

<p>This code creates points (nodes) that get connected to each other. Each node can connect to a fixed distance. the more connection a node has the wider is that range. also the size calculates that way. the nodes move over the screen over time. See the rendered videos over @ vimeo <a href="http://vimeo.com/28665864">here</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/28924785">here.</a> The nodes are a supersimple particle system. each node could als have additional data. It could als be mapped onto a lat lon map and stand for cities or or or â€¦
right now it is just what it is.
