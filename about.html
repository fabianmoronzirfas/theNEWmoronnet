<p>PD stands for Pete van Dyrker and the 13 is the number they gave me when I was young.
One part of me says I'm schizophrenic and paranoid, the other part doesn´t believe this illuminatic bastard.
I´m blessed with good karma and born on the day of terror. For fun I do cool stuff just to make you folks envy.</p>
